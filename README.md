# Parallel-Computing-Framework-Project-

A parallel computing framework is a structured environment that enables the execution of multiple computations simultaneously, leveraging multiple processors or machines to speed up problem-solving and improve efficiency. It simplifies how developers build, manage, and scale parallel applications by offering tools, libraries, and abstractions.

Here’s what makes up a typical parallel computing framework:

⚙️ Core Components

Task Scheduling: Manages how tasks are split and distributed across computing resources.

Communication Protocols: Allows processes to exchange data—often through message passing or shared memory.

Resource Management: Allocates CPU, memory, and other resources efficiently to avoid bottlenecks.

Fault Tolerance: Detects and recovers from failures in individual processes without crashing the entire system.
